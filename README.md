## Description

In this assignment, asocial networking application is provided which creates a back-end system for managing a database using the Mongoose library package's tools for more easily creating and formatting API endpoints. As we move away from handling SQL-based databases directly, libraries for implementing SQL-like functions directly into javascript code allow for more streamlined methods for performing CRUD operations.

## Dependencies

- Express v4.21.1
- Mongoose v8.8.0

## Installation

Download this repository and open it in your preferred programming environment of choice; bear in mind that a command terminal, or the ability to run git bash will be necessary. Run the command `npm i` from the root directory of the application to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

From your command terminal, enter the command `npm run seed` to seed the database with some example data (optional, recommended for testing purposes), then enter the command `npm run start` to start the local server.

Application usage can then be demonstrated by performing CRUD operations on the backend database using a REST client such as Insomnia.
